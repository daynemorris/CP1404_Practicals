# CP1404(Programming II)
## Summary

Here lies the practicals committed and pushed by Sir Dayne Morris the First. Is the code clean? Maybe Does the code follow best practice? I hope so... 

If you're reading this while reviewing my code good luck!

### Things I've learnt

- Naming plays an important role in clean code.
- Spacing improves code readability (for me).
- Making the code readable as apposed to needing comments is key.
